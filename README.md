# KaggleStart
Notebook Tutorial on Basic Kaggle Challenges

This repository contains multiple 'get started' Kaggle solutions for practise by new members of data science community

I will provide _comments_ in the notebooks to explain the process. Eg:

,,,python
from tensorflow.keras.motels import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, LSTM, SimpleRNN

#Build your model
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(25, Input=(25,25)))


with f.Session() as sess:
  #Code execution for the model goes here
